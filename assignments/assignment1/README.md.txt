What I Learned From This Assignment

This assignment helped me understand how to convert real-life problems into logical programming steps. I learned how to think step-by-step instead of randomly writing instructions.

🔹 Problem 1 – Monthly Budget Analyzer

I learned how to:

Store different values in variables

Add numbers together

Compare total expense with a fixed budget

Make a decision using conditions

This problem helped me understand how basic decision-making works in programming.

🔹 Problem 2 – Electricity Bill Estimator

From this problem, I learned:

How to take input from a user

How to apply multiple conditions

How to structure decision-making properly

I understood how programs can choose different outcomes based on different ranges of values.

🔹 Problem 3 – Class Attendance Analysis

Here I learned:

How to work with lists

How to repeat actions using loops

How to count values that meet a condition
