In this Assignment 02 (Programming for Artificial Intelligence), you learned how to design clean, modular, and real-world-like data analysis systems using structured programming and object-oriented concepts. You practiced writing reusable functions to perform calculations (average, grade, filtering), organizing data with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets in meaningful ways, building proper classes (StudentAnalytics and CourseAnalytics) with attributes and methods that process and report information, transforming data from one view to another (course-centered → student-centered), and justifying data structure choices in writing. The most common difficulties students face (and likely you did too) are: deciding when to use a set vs list vs dictionary, avoiding accidental modification of the original data, correctly implementing “strictly increasing” logic without off-by-one errors, counting distributions properly without missing edge cases (e.g., no students or empty courses), keeping functions pure (return values instead of printing), writing clear class methods that don’t repeat the same logic, and explaining design decisions convincingly in the README without copying generic text. Overall, this assignment strengthened your ability to think like an AI engineer: first organize and model data thoughtfully, then build clean, reusable analysis layers on top of it
