In this lab, I learned how to select and use Python’s lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets to organize and analyze data effectively. I practiced combining these structures, such as using lists of tuples inside dictionaries for sales and inventory management, and sets to track unique items. A key challenge was updating values in tuples due to their immutability and managing nested structures with multiple layers. Overall, this lab strengthened my ability to model real-world data, perform aggregation and filtering, and prepared me for working with Pandas in future data analysis tasks
