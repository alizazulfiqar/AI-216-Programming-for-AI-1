In this lab, I understood how to convert real-world problems into Python code using variables, conditions, and loops. I practiced decision-making using if–elif–else and learned how loops help process multiple values efficiently. It improved my logical thinking and problem-solving skills.

One challenge I faced was writing compound conditions correctly and managing counters inside loops. Sometimes I made small logical mistakes, but debugging helped me understand how the program flows.

This lab relates to AI because AI systems use the same input → process → output structure. Before building models, it is important to understand how data is processed using conditions and repeated operations.
