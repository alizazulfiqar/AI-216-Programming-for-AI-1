In this lab, I understood how to use functions to break a big problem into smaller parts. It helped me see how modular code makes programs more organized and easier to manage. I also learned how classes store data and perform actions using methods, which is very useful for AI systems.

One difficulty I faced was understanding indentation and object creation in OOP. I also made mistakes with variable names and class constructors (__init__). But after debugging, I understood how objects work.

This lab relates to AI because AI systems are built using structured components like datasets, models, and classifiers. Functions and classes help organize these components clearl
